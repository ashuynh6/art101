					<p>When I was inspecting back on my Lab 5 through console, I found warnings on how there was a failure in executing 'write' on 'Document'.<br>I tried searching up what this meant and how to resolve it but I got different suggestions on how to write document.write().<br>I asked for help from my lab partner Tien and they helped me understand that I didn't have to keep the defer link in my html header if I've already linked the script in my output, so I removed DEFER and it helped remove the warnings!</p>
